## Quick Example

```tsx
import { SwiftUI } from "@mgcrea/react-native-swiftui";
import { useState } from "react";
import { View } from "react-native";

export function MyForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");
  const [notifications, setNotifications] = useState(true);

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <SwiftUI style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <SwiftUI.Form>
          <SwiftUI.Section header="Settings">
            <SwiftUI.TextField label="Name" text={name} onChange={setName} />
            <SwiftUI.Toggle label="Enable Notifications" isOn={notifications} onChange={setNotifications} />
          </SwiftUI.Section>
        </SwiftUI.Form>
      </SwiftUI>
    </View>
  );
}
```

**Renders native SwiftUI:**
